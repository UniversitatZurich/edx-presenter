<br><br><h3>Introduction</h3>
This command line tool converts groups into an edx course.
A group is a local directory or remote GIT repository containing a 'group.yaml' file (for more information on YAML, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">wikipedia</a>). This file describes the content of the group and must contain the following properties:

<pre>
project: Project A
group: Group 1
authors:
  - name: Your Name
    email: yourEmail@Your.org
content:
  - pdf: docs/introduction.pdf
  - html: docs/html1.html
  - text: docs/simple.txt
  - html: docs/html2.html
  - file: docs/sample-data.zip
  - video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ZOMuAg2bA
  - source: src/
</pre>

The order order of the content is preserved and the same content type can be added multiple times.
The paths are expected to be relative to the directory containing the 'group.yaml' file. 
'pdf', 'html' and 'text' just process one file but 'source' processes all files in the directory and it's subdirectories.
Note that you can use LaTeX in 'html' and 'text' files inside the usual \[ ... \] block.
'video' currently supports just YouTube. Remember to make your video public, or at least unlisted.

<br><br><h3>Getting Started</h3>
There are two example projects available. The project 'edx-presenter' is actually this project and the project 'Skeleton' is a simpler one, which can be used to start a new project:
